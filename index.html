                Hello World! I am a Data Analyst based in Cambridge, MA. My career in analytics has deepened my fascination with computer code. On a rainy weekend I'm often found working through programming challenges on Project Euler's website. You can check out some of my solutions here: <strong><a href="https://www.github.com/Veganveins/ProjectEuler">Github</a></strong>). This website is the first webpage I've built by researching the basics of web design in HTML and CSS. I've already decided that my next project will involve building a web scraper capable of pulling data from an external API. Besides the technical stuff, I enjoy a tough Freeletics workout (check them out here: <strong><a href="https://www.freeletics.com/en">Freeletics</a></strong>). I also love preparing new and delicous vegan recipes, as well as watching the latest documentaries regarding climate change. The most recent film I've seen is Before the Flood, directed by Leonardo DiCaprio. You can find out more here: <strong><a href="https://www.beforetheflood.com/">Before the Flood</a></strong>.
